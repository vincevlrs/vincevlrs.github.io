		<h1><strong>About Myself</strong></h1>
		<p class = "description">I was born on January 18, 1999 at Quezon City. I am currently a Third Year BS Computer Science student at the University of the Philippines Los Banos. I got really hooked to video games when I was in High School and it really fascinated me how people created these digital games with such dynamics and detail. As such, I got engaged in the field of Computer Science and I am a prospective Software Engineer and/or Game Developer. </p>

		<h1>Favorite CMSC subject so far</h1>
		<p>Probably my favorite CMSC subject so far is CMSC 22. The way Ma'am Miyah taught the class was really interactive. She didn't miss out on any lesson and made learning Java complete. Because of CMSC 22, my favorite programming language is Java. In my opinion, Java is easy to implement and quite easy to understand. Additionally, Java is used even until today with modern applications. </p>
